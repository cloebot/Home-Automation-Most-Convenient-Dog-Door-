# Arduino Dog Door Project

Current dog door installed is poorly insulated with a uniform sized gap around the perimeter roughly 1-mm in size. To address this problem, an automated door with better insulation will be replacing it. A sensor on the dog's collar will trigger the motor to begin opening when the dog appoaches within roughly a 1-foot radius. The door must open within a reasonable amount of time, (ideally about three seconds) hopefully by use of the 5-volt power supply built into the Arduino.
